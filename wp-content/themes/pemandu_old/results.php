		<h1>Big Results Fast</h1>
		<h3>Introducing the transformation</h3>
		<p>Malaysia is at a crossroads. In 1991, the nation committed itself to Vision 2020 to become a fully developed nation by 2020. While we have made progress, at our current rate of growth, our nation is in danger of losing our competitiveness and falling short of our economic and social ambitions. A fundamental change is required, not just in economic and social performance, but also in the delivery of public goods and services that underpin our ability to develop the country. To meet the challenges standing in our way of achieving Vision 2020, we have committed ourselves to a Government Transformation Programme (GTP), in accordance with the principles of 1Malaysia, People First, Performance Now.</p>
		<br />
		<h3>Challenges to realizing Vision 2020</h3>
		<p> With Vision 2020, we committed ourselves to nine goals, encompassing economic, political, social, spiritual, psychological and cultural dimensions of our growth. Collectively, they made for a set of challenging targets for Malaysia. Under the guidance of past and present leaders, and through the hard work of the rakyat, we have made considerable progress on our journey towards 2020.</p>
		<p>Despite our achievements, it will still be challenging to fulfill our 2020 aspirations. Economically and socially, Malaysia’s performance has fallen behind and needs to be improved.</p><br />
		<h3>Catalysing Vision 2020 through 1Malaysia, People First, Performance Now</h3>
		<p>To accelerate our performance in order to achieve Vision 2020, we have formulated the GTP based on the principles of 1Malaysia, People First, Performance Now. The initiatives implemented under the GTP will reduce the disparities between the rich and poor as well as between urban and rural, thus helping us achieve the ideals of 1Malaysia. In developing the GTP and selecting the National Key Results Areas (NKRAs), we had put the people’s priorities first and will continuously seek feedback to improve this programme from the rakyat – People First. To ensure Performance Now, we have put in place mechanisms to give us higher confidence of delivery.</p><br />
		<h3>Building 1Malaysia</h3>
		<p>Creating unity within a multi-religious and multi-cultural nation is challenging. Malaysia has chosen a unique route – that of unity in diversity and inclusiveness, while ensuring fairness to all. Anchored in our Constitution, this concept means that we embrace a diversity of ethnicity, religions and beliefs and, by being inclusive, build mutual respect and acceptance into a solid foundation of trust and cohesiveness. This has historically been the path that we have taken as a nation and is now encapsulated by the principle of 1Malaysia.</p><br />
		<p>The goal of 1Malaysia is to make Malaysia more vibrant, more productive and more competitive – and ultimately a greater nation: a nation where, it is hoped, every Malaysian perceives himself or herself as Malaysian first, and by race, religion, geographical region or socio-economic background second and where the principles of 1Malaysia are embedded into the economic, political and social fabric of society.</p>
