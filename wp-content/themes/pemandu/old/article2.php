		<h1>IGP: Integrity key to success of police force</h1>
		<p>KUALA LUMPUR: The Royal Malaysian Police will step up efforts to fight crime by further improving the integrity, professionalism and image of their officers as well as modernising their equipment and infrastructure, said Inspector-General of Police, Tan Sri Ismail Omar.
"One of the key elements for success here will be to increase the integrity of my officers to an even higher level," he said at the federal police headquarters in Bukit Aman here earlier this week.
Among the senior officers present were the Deputy IGP Datuk Seri Hussin Ismail, Criminal Investigation Department director Datuk Seri Mohd Bakri Zinin, Narcotics Department director Datuk Noor Rashid Ibrahim, Commercial Crime Investigation director Datuk Syed Ismail Syed Azizan and Logistics Department director Datuk Mashuri Zainal.
Ismail admitted that there were a "few bad apples" who had tarnished the image of the force, but he said he would go all out to increase the level of professionalism of his officers through human capital development and training. 
<br />
<br />
For a start, all front-liners must look smart in their uniforms and be professional in their conduct and duties, such as stopping a car, issuing summons or taking down a report, he said.
"They must be first class in their appearance, conduct and speech," said Ismail, who became the IGP on Sept 13 last year.
Ismail added that police officers had also been directed to forge closer relations with the public, including religious bodies since he took over at the helm.
To portray an even more positive image of the force, police officers had been advised that they should attend prayers in their uniforms in mosques, temples or churches. 
<br />
<br />  
"We want to take a new approach here. I have been told that police officers in Penang, Johor and Perak had travelled together in police buses to pray and I hope that officers in other states will follow suit."
By forging closer relationships with the public, he said this would help the police to win the people's confidence and cooperation, which would go a long way to help them in their duties.
<br />
<br />
"It's about instilling greater respect and love for my officers." 
On modernising the force's infrastructure and equipment, he said it was not only about asset acquisition but also training his officers to be able to use the latest technology to combat crime.
<br />
<br />
Getting the force to be better equipped with the latest surveillance technology would enable its officers to enhance their overall capability, he added. '

"We want to make Malaysia a safe place to live... for Malaysians, investors and tourists... we want them to feel really safe," he said, adding that the police, as custodians of the law, would adopt a firm and forceful but prudent approach when dealing with those who flout the country's laws.
The police force has successfully surpassed the targets set by Pemandu (Performance Management and Delivery Unit in the Prime Minister's Department) to reduce street crime by 20 per cent and overall crime by five per cent in 2010 under the National Key Result Areas for crime. 
Malaysia's street crime index dropped by 35 per cent last year compared with 2009, while overall crime had fallen by 15 per cent compared with 2009. - Bernama</p>
