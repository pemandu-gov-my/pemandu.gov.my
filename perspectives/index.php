        <br/><br/>
        Are you living abroad? Tell us how you are doing, what do you miss, what don't you miss and if you ever wish to come back. Are you living here in Malaysia? Tell us those quirky only-in-Malaysia things that you both love and hate.
        <br/><br/>
        It doesn't matter where you are, we encourage you to contribute to this column to show your support for a stronger Malaysia.
        <br/><br/>

<h2>How to Contribute?</h2>
                    <br/>

<img src="img/pencil.png" align="right">Prepare a write up in a 1.5 A4 page in 12 point size would be more than sufficient. The idea here is to
draw on the positives (as well as frustrations to a degree) that all of you see, sentiments and emotions
related to the above with the silent majority.
<br/><br/>
Alternatively, a short 2-3 minute video would also be welcomed.
<br/><br/>
You can also touch on topics related to various current issues and the transformation programmes (GTP
& ETP). The only condition is to keep the criticisms (if any) constructive, well-balance and objective.
<br/><br/>
Please send the write up/video to <a href="mailto:perspectives@pemandu.gov.my">perspectives@pemandu.gov.my</a>
