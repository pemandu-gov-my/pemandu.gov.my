<h1>How to Contribute?</h1>
<img src="img/pencil.png" align="right">Prepare a write up in a 1.5 A4 page in 12 point size would be more than sufficient. The idea here is to
draw on the positives (as well as frustrations to a degree) that all of you see, sentiments and emotions
related to the above with the silent majority.
<br/><br/>
Alternatively, a short 2-3 minute video would also be welcomed.
<br/><br/>
You can also touch on topics related to various current issues and the transformation programmes (GTP
& ETP). The only condition is to keep the criticisms (if any) constructive, well-balance and objective.
