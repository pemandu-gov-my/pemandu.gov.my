<h2>Some Title Here</h2><br/>
This column serves to highlight heartfelt messages from Malaysians across all walks of life based on
what they wish for the country to be. The collection of messages is by Malaysians who have not given up
hope for the country and continue to strive for a better tomorrow.

<li>Want to contribute to the overall social and infrastructure health of the country
<li>Seek to make changes in either the administrative, governance or policies of the country through positive affirmative action
<li>Provide constructive feedback, recommendations, suggestions or examples that may improve the country's governance further, so as to ensure Malaysia stays relevant to the bright and dedicated populace
<li>Ability to see the positives of being a Malaysian amidst the political noise which is sometimes irrelevant to our lives
<li>Simply want to see difference in the country
</ul>
<br/>
<b>How to Contribute?</b>
<br/><br/>
Prepare a write up in a 1.5 A4 page in 12 point size would be more than sufficient. The idea here is to
draw on the positives (as well as frustrations to a degree) that all of you see, sentiments and emotions
related to the above with the silent majority.
<br/><br/>
Alternatively, a short 2-3 minute video would also be welcomed.
<br/><br/>
You can also touch on topics related to various current issues and the transformation programmes (GTP
& ETP). The only condition is to keep the criticisms (if any) constructive, well-balance and objective.
