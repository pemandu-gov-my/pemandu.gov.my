                    I sip on this delicately brewed long black whilst waiting for a client. Next to me was a table of what seem to be uni students- the oversized bags, blocks of books and a familiar something that caught my attention. I couldn't help but eaves-drop the conversation that was taking place. The familiar words of 'Changkat' and 'O.U' instantly brought the memory of home to mind. They'll have to be my fellow countrymen or 'homies', as I usually regard my Malaysian friends here. Approaching my tenth year of stay in Australia, I've noticed a rapidly growing number of my 'homies' living here. A quick Google research tells me that the number of Malaysians Australian to-date exceeds a large six figure number- if I may quote, "unrealistically high"github.
                    <br/><br/>
                    In the last six months, I have made several short trips home and I can never get enough. Like meeting your boyfriend's parents for the first time, there is a slight air of nervousness and a plethora of questions thrown at me every time I am present at family reunions- When are you coming back again? Do you really like Australia that much? Any plans to return... for good? Noticing the deepening of lines across my dear parents' foreheads and understanding their hardship, a flame remains alight at my very core, moving me deeply and leaving me more determined each time.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Whilst I come from a country that once had the world's tallest buildings or astronauts who touched down in space, with the latter financed by the Government, I'm not sure if there was a wiser way to maximise our financial budget. I cringe each time I read pieces of news with a great deal of sexual connotation that dominate The Star's daily ranks even worse, on Melbourne's daily- The Age. As the growing numbers of Malaysians appreciate elsewhere around the globe, I can't help but ask, is Malaysia's intellectual slowly shrinking? Why is everyone leaving? Can we do anything?

                    Last weekend, as the Australian media made way for carbon tax announcements, my 'homies' rallied for Bersih 2.0 aka Walk of Democracy. Some of my friends were keen to post Facebook updates, whilst others like me, refused to acknowledge the chaos that was happening in my home. As for me, I continued to sip my long black and watched marathons of The Sopranos.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I cannot deny that I miss my friends and family at home a great deal. Living here hasn't always been a bed of roses. A large chunk of my pay cheque goes to taxes, and I wish there was a leniency on non-Australians in that regard. Nonetheless, I let the goodness speak for itself- ducking into the city at ungodly words for a tucker, burning it the next day at a park (minus my mum's naggy precautions of wearing lose, unflattering fitness garment) or even just leaving my handbag on the empty seat next to me.  They may be the simplest of examples but for a woman, it keeps the can of worms closed.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I was never interested in any political governance, but after watching a documentary on Barack Obama, I am awestruck. Like other Bersih supporters, I too wish for the same democracy. I'm sure many would agree that we are in dire need of a massive 'spring clean'. No dirty politics, no restricted media, no corruption, cleaner electoral roll, reform postal ballot and most importantly, freedom of speech.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Like everything else, a bright future awaits us. There is room for improvement and I look forward to it.
